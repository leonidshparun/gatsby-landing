      'We were initially skeptical of doing any development with an outside firm, but CleverSoft has been a great partner. The team at CleverSoft is very skilled and has been a pleasure to work with. Not only have they enabled us to expand our team but they have added capability as well. They have enabled us to adopt new technologies as they add their diverse skillset to our team. I would not hesitate to recommend CleverSoft to anyone looking for a great software development company.'

    feedback:
      'CleverSoft helped BullionRock to bridge a huge gap in our systems. Having committed to, at one end, off-the-shelf back-office accounting software and, at the other, a client-facing secure web portal, we needed an order management system middle office application to tie the two together. After months of patient and understanding dialogue, whilst we (non-technical financial types) grappled with exactly what we wanted, CleverSoft were quick to deliver the project - which exceeded our expectations and was completed well within budget. We are as grateful to the team, who continue to support and develop the system to our changing requirements, now as we were in 2012.'

      'We outsourced our development to CleverSoft 3 years ago and very quickly forged an excellent working relationship, initially with our client manager Maryia Marozava, our project manager Aleh Yanovich and subsequently the rest of the team. CleverSoft have proved themselves to be dedicated to the project and have a "Can Do"  attitude and will do what it takes to get a job done and it is a pleasure working with the team. The team very quickly understood what we were trying to achieve and have contributed to ideas which has helped move our development forward at a faster pace. Our relationship is now a long term one. After three years we fully expect to work with ES for many years to come, helping us bring world class software to market.'

      'We were searching the world for a text summariser, and were delighted to discover the Intellexer API from CleverSoft. After discussing our requirements with their team, it was evident that their solutions would not just meet our requirements but would also do more things than we had originally envisaged. It is also of great and ongoing benefit that they continue to develop their products so that we can offer new things to our customers. I thoroughly recommend CleverSoft to others. They are a really responsive team to work with.'

      'Our long-term cooperation with CleverSoft dates back to 2008. Since then we`ve been working on a number of complex lasting projects, and practically all the time CleverSoft was able to satisfy our immediate needs in resources and to meet our high demands for project results. We haven`t finished our current projects yet, but I am already looking forward to broaden our common horizons.'
